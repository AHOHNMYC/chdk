SX710 HS notes
************************************
CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

This is an ALPHA port. Some CHDK features have not been tested.

Additionally, Digic 6 has significant differences from previously 
supported models, which means some features are not fully implemented
and the risk of unforeseen side effects is higher than ports for
previous Digic versions.

The VER.REQ method works to obtain the Canon firmware. VERS.REQ does not

No "firmware update" file is included in the autobuild, you must used
bootable SD card to load. See known bugs below.


General camera and CHDK port information
****************************************
Default alt button is PLAY. VIDEO and WIFI may also be used

Subject distance (focus) override is available only when MF or AF lock is set

Only simple_movie_status is implemented, so features or scripts that rely on
direct access to the movie_status variable do not work

When running a script ~600k of RAM is available to CHDK.

This camera has an adjustable aperture and does not have an ND filter.

OTHER ISSUES
************
display updating is ugly / has usual Digic 6 limitations
- Edge overlay does not erase properly when shown live
- Zebra "Draw Over Zebra" and Restore options are non-functional
- Some games don't draw correctly
DNG color matrix is incorrect (copied from sx60hs) but usable

KNOWN BUGS
**********
- When booted with FI2 update
 - switching to hybrid auto causes a crash
 Because of this issue, an FI2 file is not included in the autobuild
