SX700 HS porting notes
******************************

Many features and combinations of Canon settings have not been tested.

CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!
This is a new port for a model with many hardware differences from previously
supported models, so it is probably higher risk than most.

The VER.REQ/VERS.REQ method does not work to obtain the Canon firmware
version, use ACID or the firminfo Canon Basic script.

No "firmware update" file is included in the autobuild, you must used
bootable SD card to load. See known bugs below.

Bugs should be reported in the porthing thread
https://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=12532.0

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: I want to thank reyalp, without whose handholding,
this port would not have been possible.

General camera and CHDK port information
****************************************

-- Port was started on Firmware 100E

-- SX700 HS uses propset 6.  The values in some propcases have changed.

-- Does not need CHDK ExpDrv apex2us in order to shoot long
exposures. Exposures upto 10 minutes have been taken to test this. . Thus
the CHDK ExpDrv hooks if an #if 0 ... #endif around them in both boot.c
and capt_seq.c. Uncomment if needed. The assembler code is correct
for those.

-- A few extra shooting modes are present. These are
numbers 32831, 32832, 33345, 16943, 16945, 33295. None of
these is accessible via Canon menu. These were checked with
set_capture_mode_canon(MODENUM). MODENUM=33295 seemed to
crash the camera. The only one that was identified is 32831
(MODE_NIGHT_SNAPSHOT). The rest are in shooting.c but commented out.




TESTED
******
Tested:
Overrides -- Av, Tv
Bracketed shooting in continuous mode (Av, Tv)
DNG shooting
SD override does not work with     //#define CAM_SD_OVER_IN_AF  1
Scripted shooting (Lua scripts -- isobase, llibtst, hooktest)
Connected shooting -- ptpchdk
chdkptp camtests
chdkptp rsint tested (filewrite)


Dark subtraction
Long Exposure (10 mins)

Not implemented yet:
Video -- movie rec task

Issues:  
Ugly display updating (usual DIGIC 6 limitations)
