IXUS150/ELPH140 Notes 
************************************

To enter CHDK <ALT> mode use the [>] Play button.
This may be changed to [?] Help in the options.
The Video button is used as RAW / Debug shortcut.

This camera does not have an adjustable aperture. It does have an ND filter.

This is an alpha port, use at your own risk!

TESTED
******
(TODO tests were done with non-standard MEMISOSTART)
usb remote hook - simple plug / unplug test

OTHER ISSUES
************
The hide OSD when pressing DISP in half shoot shortcut is not available, since the camera has no DISP key

KNOWN BUGS
**********
DNG color matrix is copy+paste from Ixus160 (which is likely also copied)

DEVELOPER NOTES
***************
- there's space that appears to be unused, after the DryOS kernel:
  kernel region starts at 0x6b1000, ends at 0x6f0fff, free from 0x6c1404
- camera live view runs at 25 frames per second
- strange out-of-memory situation occured a few times during early testing, reason unknown
- most DryOS r54 kernel functions no longer accept invalid (such as zero) object IDs
