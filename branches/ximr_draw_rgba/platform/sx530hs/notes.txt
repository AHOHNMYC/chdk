SX530 Notes
************************************
To enter CHDK <ALT> mode use the [>] Play button.

CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

Known issues

The camera's "front dial" (scrollwheel on the top) is not supported by CHDK.
The back dial can be used to scroll in the CHDK menu, but its scroll events go through the Canon UI and may change settings inadvertently.

Developer notes

The scrollwheel issues need either a developer or a reliable tester, see "JogDial_task_my" in boot.c.
