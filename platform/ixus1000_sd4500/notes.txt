IXUS1000/SD4500 Notes

Press the Movie button briefly to enter CHDK alt mode. You can configure CHDK
to use the Playback button instead. For the normal function of the button
(recording a video or switching to playback), press it longer.

The "Switch Partitions" feature should work if you switch the camera off and
back on.

------------
Known issues

The camera may crash if you try to switch into recording mode over PTP.

The "Make Card Bootable" option may be broken; use a computer instead.

CR2 RAW files are broken (because of the GRBG Bayer pattern) so use DNG.
badpixels.bin generation seems to be broken, so only DNG 1.3 is available and
not all RAW converters will fully work.

Liveview does not work. Tested on 101a:

setmode.lua claims it fails to change from VIDEO_COLOR_ACCENT to
VIDEO_COLOR_SWAP even though it works.
