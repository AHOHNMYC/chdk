Powershot N Facebook Notes
************************************
Note : this is essentially the same camera as the Powershot N with the wifi code changed to connect to Facebook

CHDK Wiki Page :  http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/Powershot_N

Camera will boot with firmware update method if microSD card has ps.fi2 file in root of SD card.

Camera will autoboot ("SD Card Lock") if microSD card slot cover is left open  and card is 
prepared like a normal SD card for CHDK.

<ALT> mode switch is the "wifi enable" switch above the "Playback" button. Short press for <ALT> and
long press for wifi enable function.

Camera will not switch from playback to shooting by pressing the shutter ring (unrelated to CHDK). Pressing
the play button in playback mode enables shooting mode.


Know bugs & issues
******************
Camera may not be capabile of AFL or MF. Seems to be no way to disable Continuous AF mode.
Camera has many 'creative' modes that also apply to video - effects of CHDK unknown at this point.


Things to be done :
******************
  video :               Bitrate / quality controls are not supported
  platform_camera.h :   several values at end of file still to be checked 
  shooting.c :          aperture_sizes_table  shutter_speeds_table  iso_table not customized for the N
